Fixes
-----

 - Fixed support for range queries on the ``_id`` and ``_uid`` columns. These
   queries were not working since version 2.0.0 (Issue: `#5845`_).

 - Fixed an issue when ``RENAME`` is used on a partitioned table, which would
   result in data loss if a new table was created with the old name, and then
   afterwards was dropped (Issue: `#5823`_).
