Changelog
=========

Breaking Changes
----------------

 - Changed default required shard copies for table creation and write
   operations from ``quorum`` to ``all``.

 - Changed the default value of ``number_of_replicas`` from ``1`` to ``0-1``.

Changes
-------

 - Expose new setting ``write.wait_for_active_shards`` to allow users to
   adjust the required shard copies for write operation to their needs.

 - Expose fields for ``information_schema.columns`` and
   ``information_schema.tables`` so that it conforms to SQL-99 standard.

Fixes
-----

 - Added missing table setting ``translog.durability`` which is required and
   must be set accordingly so that ``translog.sync_interval`` takes effect.

 - Fixed a NPE when querying ``sys.shards`` table.

 - Log failed authentication attempts at log level ``WARN``.
