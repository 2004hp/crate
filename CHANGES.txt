Changelog
=========

 - Fixed a bug which caused non-grouping aggregations on a join with explicit
   `CROSS JOIN` syntax to fail.

 - Correctly expose ``stats.service.interval`` in the ``sys.cluster``
   table.

 - Re-added compatibility layer that was removed in 1.1 and resulted in
   exception thrown when trying to run aggregations on tables created
   with CrateDB < 0.52.0.

 - Fixed a race condition which could cause a memory leak

 - Updated documentation to indicate that it's not possible to use
    ``object``, ``geo_point``, ``geo_shape`` or ``array`` in the
    ``ORDER BY`` clause.

 - Fixed cluster check, which warns about tables that need upgrade for
   future compatibility, to include only tables that differ from
   current storage engine major version number.

 - Fixed issue which prevents blob directories from being removed after a
   ``drop blob table`` command when a custom blob location is configured.
