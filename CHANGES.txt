Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

- Table functions no longer require any permissions to be used. (Enterprise
  only)

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue in binary encoding/decoding of array types in Postgres Wire
  Protocol affecting the ``npgsql`` driver.

- As Windows does not support sending signals, stop attempting to handle the
  ``USR2`` signal on windows platforms as it just pollutes the logs with a big
  warning.

- Fixed a performance regression which occurred in queries where a literal was
  compared against an array column of a different type. For example:
  ``Select * from t1 where 1 = ANY(int_arr_column)`` <- array column would be
  converted to long although 1 could have been converted to integer.

- Fixed an issue where the order of the relations in FROM would expose fields
  between the relations. An error was thrown during execution of the statements.

- Fixed incorrect HTTP responses on the BLOB API of subsequent requests after
  an error response occurred, e.g. 404 Not Found.

- Fixed an issue that caused ``ANY`` to not work correctly on nested arrays.

- Fixed an issue that would cause a NullPointerException to be thrown when
  executing an ``EXPLAIN`` statement for a ``CROSS JOIN``.
