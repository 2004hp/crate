Changes
=======

Fixes
=====

 - Fix thread-safety issue for scalar functions ``md5`` and ``sha1``

 - ``information.schema.tables`` now returns the default routing hash function
   if none is present in the table metadata.
   (Issue: https://github.com/crate/crate/issues/5857)

 - Fixed an issue that caused an exception to be thrown when using
   ``COUNT(*)`` with subselects that return one row. E.g.::

     SELECT count(*) FROM t1 WHERE id > (select max(col1) from t2)

 - Throw proper exception when using the ``_raw`` column inside the where clause
   instead of silently ignoring it.
