Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

- Arrays can now contain mixed types if they're safely convertible. JSON
  libraries tend to encode values like ``[ 0.0, 1.2]`` as ``[ 0, 1.2 ]``, this
  caused an error because of the strict type match we enforced before.

Fixes
=====

- Do not allow renaming a table when connected to a read-only node.
