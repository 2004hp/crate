Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that caused incorrect results for queries with joins on more
  than 2 tables with implicit join conditions using the ``ON`` clause and
  ``LIMIT`` is applied. E.g. ::

     SELECT * from t1
     INNER JOIN t2 on t1.id = t2.id
     INNER JOIN t3 on t3.id = t2.id
     LIMIT 100

- Fixed an issue that could cause a ``ALTER TABLE`` statement to fail with an
  exception on partitioned tables created with CrateDB < 1.2.

- Enforce validation of column constraints for ``INSERT`` statements with a
  subquery as source and in combination with ``ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE``.

- Fixed an issue that caused an error to be thrown when using ``GROUP BY`` or
  ``DISTINCT`` on a column of type ``IP`` in case there are rows with null
  value for that column.
