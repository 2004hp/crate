Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

Fixes
=====

 - The internal ``fetchSize`` now has an upper bound to prevent ``OutOfMemory``
   errors if a postgres client retrieves a large result set without setting a
   ``fetchSize``, or setting a ``fetchSize`` which is too large.

 - Fixed a race condition which could cause ``KILL (ALL)`` to terminate a node
   instead of interrupting a query.

 - Log failed authentication attempts at log level ``WARN``
