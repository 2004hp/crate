Breaking Changes

Changes

Fixes
=====

 - Fixed issue that caused ``NULL`` values to be displayed as
   empty objects in the console view of the Admin UI.

 - Fixed an issue that resulted in aliases overriding column names when a
   subselect is used and a column appears in the outer SELECT multiple times,
   without an alias and with alias or with multiple aliases. E.g.::

     SELECT a, a AS newcol FROM (SELECT a FROM t WHERE a > 1)
     SELECT a AS newcol1, a AS newcol2 FROM (SELECT a FROM t WHERE a > 1)
