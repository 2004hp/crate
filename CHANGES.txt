Breaking Changes

Changes
=======

Fixes
=====

- Removed the horizontal scroll from the console editor.

- Console results pagination is now reset to 1 after each execution.

- Calculate "idle" process CPU usage correctly and show it in the
  "CrateDB CPU Usage" graph.

- Fixed an issue that caused the Admin UI to not display any tables when the
  file system data are not available.

- Refresh Cluster Info after query execution in the console, to ensure that
  the cluster info is always up to date.

- Fixed an issue that caused incorrect results for collapsable subselects which
  contained a ``WHERE`` clause that results in no match. E.g. ::

    SELECT * FROM (
      SELECT * FROM t
      WHERE false
    ) vt

- Fixed a performance regression introduced in ``2.2.0`` that caused ``SELECT``
  statements with ``ORDER BY`` and ``LIMIT`` to execute way slower than before

- Fixed support for subscript expressions on the ``values`` column of
  ``information_schema.table_partitions``
