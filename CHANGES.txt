Changes
=======

 - Expose fields for ``information_schema.columns`` and
   ``information_schema.tables`` so that it conforms to SQL-99 standard.

Fixes
=====

   to return the wrong result.

 - Fixed a bug in the memory accounting of the circuit breaker for HTTP
   results when querying ``GEO_SHAPE`` columns.

 - Reflect internally used default size for ``translog.flush_threshold_size``
   also in documentation and expose the correct default value in table
   settings.

 - Added missing table setting ``translog.durability`` which is required and
   and must be set accordingly so that ``translog.sync_interval`` takes effect.
