Breaking Changes

Changes
=======

Fixes
=====

 - Fixed an issue that caused an exception to be thrown when using
   ``COUNT(*)`` with subselects that return one row. E.g.::

     SELECT count(*) FROM t1 WHERE id > (select max(col1) from t2)

 - Throw proper exception when using the ``_raw`` column inside the where clause
   instead of silently ignoring it.
