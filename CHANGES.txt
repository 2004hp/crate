Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

- Changed internals for DELETE and UPDATE queries which should generally result
  in a performance increase for queries which only match a subset of the rows
  and avoid ``CircuitBreakingException`` errors. But it might result in a
  slight performance decrease if the queries match all
  or almost all records.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that could prevent postgres clients from receiving an error and
  therefore getting stuck.

- Fixed an issue that would cause a ``CAST`` from ``TIMESTAMP`` to ``LONG`` to
  be ignored.

- Handle ``STRING_ARRAY`` as argument type for user-defined functions correctly
  to prevent an ``ArrayStoreException``.
