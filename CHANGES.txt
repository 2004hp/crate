Changes

Fixes
=====

 - Fix display of redundant parenthesis around expressions visible in 
   `SHOW CREATE` and `EXPLAIN` statements.

 - Updated Crash to ``0.21.5`` which removes a deprecation warning logged in
   CrateDB server on every REST request.

 - Fixed an issue that caused `path.logs` setting in `crate.yml` to be ignored.

 - Fixed column name in output by removing new lines when select list contains
   subquery. E.g.::

     SELECT 1 =
         (SELECT 1)

 - Fixed an issue that prevents CrateDB from bootstrap on Windows hosts.

 - Fixed an issue that caused queries with ``IS NULL`` or ``IS NOT NULL` on
   columns of type ``geo_point`` to fail.

 - Changed ``crate`` unix/linux startup script to use standard ``sh`` syntax
   instead of ``bash`` specific syntax.
