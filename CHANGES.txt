Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

Fixes
=====

 - Fixed a race condition that could lead to ``KILL (ALL)`` causing queries to
   get stuck instead of interrupting them.

 - Fixed validation so that ``SELECT DISTINCT`` can be used only if there
   is no ``GROUP BY`` present or if the set of ``GROUP BY`` expressions is
   the same as the set ``SELECT`` expressions.

 - Added validation that ``ORDER BY`` symbols are included in the ``SELECT``
   list when ``DISTINCT`` is used.
