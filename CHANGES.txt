Changelog
=========
 
 - Added possible data type conversion to a timestamp array.
   e.g. ``cast(['2017-01-01','2017-12-31'] as array(timestamp))``

 - Fixed bug introduced in 1.1.0 which caused all partitioned tables to
   become unusable.

 - Fixed an issued that caused conditions like ``not x = any( )`` to not 
   find empty lists when used in WHERE clauses.

 - Improved error handling when using LIMIT/OFFSET that exceed Integer range

 - Fixed a regression introduced in 1.1.0 that caused statements like ``COPY t
   TO '/invalid/directory/'`` to get stuck instead of resulting in an error.
