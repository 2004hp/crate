Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

 - Updated Elasticsearch to v5.6.8

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue where a null pointer exception would be thrown when trying to
  move reroute shards to/from non-data nodes using ``ALTER TABLE REROUTE``.

- Fixed an issue that would cause queries and data manipulation statements with
  explicit ``WHERE`` conditions to throw ``NullPointerException`` when running
  against a table with a composite primary key.

- Fixed a race condition that could cause the decommissioning of nodes using
  the graceful shutdown procedure to interrupt the execution of active queries.

- Read only queries should no longer fail with a ``TableUnknownException`` or
  ``IndexNotFoundException`` in case of a shard relocation.
