the appropriate section of the docs.

Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

 - Enabled ``mapping.total_fields.limit`` setting for tables in order to be
   able to increase maximum number of columns higher than the default
   of ``1000``.

Fixes
=====

 - Optimized the algorithm that determines the best ordering of the tables in
   a ``JOIN``.

 - Fixed a regression causing incorrect results for queries with ``DISTINCT``
   on scalar functions. E.g.::

     SELECT DISTINCT upper(name) FROM t

 - Fixed a NPE when running ``select port from sys.nodes`` and
   ``psql.enabled: false`` was set

 - Fixed a race condition which made it possible to create new columns in a
   partition of a partitioned table that didn't match the type of the same
   column of sibling partitions.

 - Fixed a NPE when running ``select port from sys.nodes`` and
   ``psql.enabled: false`` was set

 - Fixed an issue where the user that gets provided by the client on connect is
   not always used as current user if host based authentication is disabled.

 - Corrected the documentation of the ``version`` column of the ``sys.snapshots``
   table. It was described as the CrateDB version wereas it's an internal
   version instead.

 - Dropping an empty partitioned table did not drop related table privileges.

 - Implemented ``NOT NULL`` constraint validation for nested object columns,
   which was previously ignored. E.g.::

     CREATE TABLE test (
       stuff object(dynamic) AS (
         level1 object(dynamic) AS (
           level2 string not null
         ) NOT NULL
       ) NOT NULL
     )
