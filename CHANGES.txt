Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

 - Changed the ``QueryStats`` JMX MBean to deliver node-based values instead of
   cluster-based values.
   This makes it possible to spot performance discrepancies between nodes more
   easily.

Fixes
=====

 - Optimized the JMX ``QueryStats`` MBean to prevent it from putting too much
   load on the cluster.

 - Fixed the calculation of the ``OverallQueryAverageDuration`` ``QueryStats``
   MBean.

 - The internal ``fetchSize`` now has an upper bound to prevent ``OutOfMemory``
   errors if a postgres client retrieves a large result set without setting a
   ``fetchSize``, or setting a ``fetchSize`` which is too large.

 - Fixed a race condition that could lead to ``KILL (ALL)`` causing queries to
   get stuck instead of interrupting them.

 - Fixed validation so that ``SELECT DISTINCT`` can be used only if there
   is no ``GROUP BY`` present or if the set of ``GROUP BY`` expressions is
   the same as the set ``SELECT`` expressions.

 - Added validation that ``ORDER BY`` symbols are included in the ``SELECT``
   list when ``DISTINCT`` is used.
