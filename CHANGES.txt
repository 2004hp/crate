Changes

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that caused a ``NullPointerException`` using ``ANY`` on
  timestamp columns.

- Fixed an issue that resulted in an unusable partitioned table when at least
  one column was defined with an explicit ``COLUMNSTORE`` setting.

- Fixed an issue that would cause `count(*)` to return the wrong count when
  applied to a subquery.

- Fixed an issue that could cause ``JOIN`` queries with ``ORDER BY`` to return
  incorrect results.

- Fixed an issue that caused ``COPY TO`` with filters on primary key columns to
  fail.
