Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

 - Updated Elasticsearch to v5.6.8

Fixes
=====

- Fixed the URL linking to stats collection documentation in the monitoring
  tab of the Admin UI.

- Updated the table list search field to filter tables only by table name and
  table schema in the Admin UI.

- Fixed an issue in the Admin UI that caused the table list to display wrong
  results.

- Re-enable implicit casting for columns whenever columns are used on both 
  sides of an operator or function. The implicit cast will obey the type 
  precedence (eg. long > integer)

- Fixed an issue that caused incorrect results to be returned when ``WHERE``
  clause filters on a partitioned and an non-partitioned column. E.g.::

    SELECT * FROM t WHERE parted_col='value' AND other_col='some_value'

- Fixed an issue that causes ``JOINS`` with certain ``ORDER BY`` constructs to
  fail.

- Fixed an issue where a null pointer exception would be thrown when trying to
  move reroute shards to/from non-data nodes using ``ALTER TABLE REROUTE``.

- Fixed an issue that would cause queries and data manipulation statements with
  explicit ``WHERE`` conditions to throw ``NullPointerException`` when running
  against a table with a composite primary key.

- Fixed a race condition that could cause the decommissioning of nodes using
  the graceful shutdown procedure to interrupt the execution of active queries.

- Read only queries should no longer fail with a ``TableUnknownException`` or
  ``IndexNotFoundException`` in case of a shard relocation.
