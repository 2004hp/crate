Changes

Fixes
=====

 - Fixed support for range queries on the ``_id`` and ``_uid`` columns, range
   queries on these columns weren't working at all since v2.0.0.
   Issue: https://github.com/crate/crate/issues/5845

 - Fixed an issue on ``RENAME`` a partitioned table which would result in data
   loss if a new table is created with the old name of the renamed table and
   afterwards dropped. Issue: https://github.com/crate/crate/issues/5823
