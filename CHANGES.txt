Breaking Changes

Changes
=======

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that caused an ``UnsupportedFeatureException`` to be thrown
  when deleting or updating by query on an empty partitioned table, instead of
  just returning 0 rows deleted/updated.

- Fixed an issue which could result in lost entries at the ``sys.jobs_log`` and
  ``sys.operations_log`` tables when the related settings are changed while
  entries are written.
