Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

Fixes
=====

- Fixed an issue that caused nodes to crash with ``OutOfMemoryException`` when
  executing queries with ``ORDER BY`` on large data sets. Instead, the query
  circuit breaker is tripped, the query is killed and the nodeâ€™s health is
  unaffected.

- Improved the error handling for a race condition to make sure it doesn't
  cause queries to get stuck.

- Improved the behaviour in case the cluster drops below the number of minimum
  nodes. The root REST endpoint will no longer timeout and ``sys.checks`` can
  still be queried, similar to how ``sys.nodes`` can still be queried.
