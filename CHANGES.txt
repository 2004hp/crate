Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

Fixes
=====

 - Fixed an issue that could cause ``DELETE`` statements to fail instead of
   "not matching" if there was a ``_version`` column in the ``WHERE`` clause.

 - Fixed an error handling issue that could lead to the termination of a node
   in very rare cases. (Usually if a user invoked the ``KILL`` statement)

 - Fixed issue where bulk operations like `insert from dynamic queries` and 
   ``COPY FROM`` did not stop after being killed.    

 - ``CREATE USER`` and ``DROP USER`` statements will now only respond after all
   nodes in the cluster processed the change.

 - Fixed an issue that caused an exception to be thrown when using ``unnest``
   with 10 or more columns.
