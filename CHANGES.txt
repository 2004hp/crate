Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

Fixes
=====

 - Fix: Usage of ``DISTINCT`` in a query with a ``GROUP BY`` was producing
   wrong results and  was changed to throw UnsupportedOperationException.
   e.g.: ``SELECT DISTINCT col1 from t1 GROUP BY col2, col1``

 - Fix: An error was thrown when using ``ORDER BY count(*)`` on ``JOINS``.
   e.g.: ``SELECT count(*) from t1, t2 order by 1``

 - Fixed Admin UI ``y-axis`` number formatting for long running queries
   in the monitoring plugin.
