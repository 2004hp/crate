Breaking Changes
================

Changes
=======

Fixes
=====
 
 - Improved the accuracy of results if arithmetic operators +,-,*,/ are used
   in expressions that contain only float-type values.

 - Fixed validation so that ``SELECT DISTINCT`` can be used only if there
   is no ``GROUP BY`` present or if the set of ``GROUP BY`` expressions is
   the same as the set ``SELECT`` expressions.

 - Added validation that ``ORDER BY`` symbols are included in the ``SELECT``
   list when ``DISTINCT`` is used.

 - Removed ``psql.enabled`` and ``psql.port`` settings from ``sys.cluster``
   because they where wrongly exposed in this table.

 - Fixed `copy from` to be able to copy data into a partitioned table with a 
   generated column as both the primary key and the partitioned column.

 - NullPointerException thrown when selecting ``routing_hash_function``
   or ``version`` columns from sys.shards for blob tables.

 - Fixed an issue which caused failing `sys.snapshot` queries if the
   `data.path` of an existing fs repository was not configured anymore

 - Fixed error thrown when applying filtering, ordering or limit on
   joins with more than 2 tables.

 - Use the region of the EC2 instance for EC2 discovery when neither
   ``cloud.aws.ec2.endpoint`` nor ``cloud.aws.region`` are specified or do not
   resolve in a valid service endpoint.

 - Use crate favicon instead of elasticsearch.

 - Fixed issue which lead to an object's column policy being changed to
   the default DYNAMIC when adding a nested object column using the
   `alter table` statement.

 - Fix: `sys.snapshot` queries hung instead of throwing an error if something
   went wrong.

 - Fixed an issue with `regexp_replace`: In some cases it used the third
   argument as flags parameter instead of the fourth argument.

 - Fixed an issue which lead to brief unavailability of already registered
   functions after a function was created or dropped in the same schema.

 - Improved error message when trying to update an element of an array.

 - Fixed a regression that lead to `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` if a JOIN
   query was made with a WHERE clause on partitioned columns.

 - Fixed a NullPointerException which could occur if an attempt was made to use
   `match` on two different relations within an explicit join condition.
   This now raises a proper error stating that it's not supported.

 - Wrong results were returned from queries with more than one level
   of nested subselects.

 - ``ORDER BY`` on joins caused incorrect order of values when having multiple
   non-distinct values on the left part of the join. Now ``ORDER BY`` is
   correctly applied.

 - Fix: Appearance of NPE during startup of crate

 - Fix: Log4j would yield a "No log4j2 configuration file found" error when
   shutting down crate ungracefully (via kill signal)

 - Fix: Restoring empty partitioned tables wasn't possible
