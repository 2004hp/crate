=======
REFRESH
=======

Refresh a table explicitly.

Synopsis
========

.. code-block:: sql

    REFRESH TABLE table_ident

Description
===========

The REFRESH TABLE command refreshes a table and all its rows,
making all changes made to that table available to all further commands.

Without issuing this statement there is no guarantee that a change
(``UPDATE``, ``DELETE``, ``COPY`` or ``INSERT``) will be seen by an
immediately following ``SELECT`` statement for the row(s) affected by
this change. By default a refresh is scheduled periodically.

Internally a refresh opens a new table reader, which is then used by
all subsequent searches on the affected table.

For examples see: :ref:`refreshing_data`.

Parameters
==========

:table_ident: The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing
    table that is to be refreshed.
