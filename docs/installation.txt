Installation Instructions
=========================

.. highlight:: sh

After downloading the latest stable version of Crate Data from
https://crate.io/download/ the package needs to be unpacked::

   sh$ tar zxf crate-*.tar.gz

Now Cate can be started in the foreground like this::

   sh$ ./bin/crate

In order to start in the background add the `-d` option. If started in the
foreground you can use Control-C to stop the process again.


.. note::

  Crate Data needs a working Java 7 virtual machine. We recommend
  using `Oracle's Java`_ on OSX and OpenJDK_ on Linux Systems.
