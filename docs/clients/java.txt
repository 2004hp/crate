Crate Java Client
=================

.. highlight:: java

To access a Crate Cluster one can use the the installed crate package
directly just by adding the ``lib`` dir to the classpath. The client
module exposes a very simple interface to query Crate using SQL.

Usage
-----

A minimal example is just a few lines of code::

    import io.crate.client.CrateClient;

    CrateClient client = new CrateClient("server1.crate.org:4300", "server2.crate.org:4300");
    SQLResponse r = client.sql("select firstName, lastName from users").actionGet();

    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(r.cols()));
    // outputs ["firstName", "lastName"]

    for (Object[] row: r.rows()){
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(row));
    }
    // outputs the users. For example:
    // ["Arthur", "Dent"]
    // ["Ford", "Perfect"]

The `CrateClient` takes multiple servers as arguments. They are used in a
round-robin fashion to distribute the load. In case a server is unavailable it
will be skipped.

Queries are executed asynchronous. `client.sql("")` will return a
`Future<SQLResponse>` and code execution is only blocked if `.actionGet()` is
called on it.
